    <p>According to Uncover Cailfornia , the reason we find dogs so cute is something called the domestication syndrome. Now what exactly is this? The phenomenon was first observed by the father of evolution, Charles Darwin nearly 140 years ago. He was seeking answers to why wild animals and domesticated animals, like dogs, had features that varied greatly. Today's research was carried out at Humboldt University of Berlin in Germany.

It turns out that humans have a pretty big part in domestication syndrome. When we breed animals for characteristics we like, such as floppy ears, fur color or snout length, we are actually favoring genetic defects. Humans find some features appealing that nature just did not want in the gene pool. This explains why a wild dog, or wolf, look similar to a dog but just isn't quite the same. It's probable that other animals, like birds and horses, lso have different physical appearances because of human intervention.</p>
